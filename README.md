## Project Architecture
![3](images/archi.png)
The **Docker-based architecture** enables end-to-end machine learning workflows by orchestrating components within a single network. Data is fetched using Dagster, and experiments along with trained models are stored in MLflow. MLflow serves the trained models via FastAPI, providing an API for real-time predictions. The API can be accessed through JupyterLab or cURL for local testing, ensuring seamless model deployment and interaction.  

The **GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline** ensures code quality and reliability through automated checks and testing. Pre-commit hooks enforce formatting and linting standards using tools like Flake8, Black, and Isort. Pytest validates functionality, and successful tests allow changes to be merged, maintaining a robust and well-tested codebase.

## Directory Structure
- `.github/workflows` - contains `pre-commit.yml` defines what is run in github actions
- `images` - image reference to markdown files
- `src` - source directory
  - `api` - fastapi source code to predict from deployed model
  - `dagster` - train model and register model to mlflow
  - `notebooks` - notebook to test 
  - `dockerfiles` - all container dockerfiles consolidated here
- `tests` - test directory

## Github Actions
- pre-commit
  - See `.github/workflows/pre-commit.yml` and `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- pytest
  - See `tests/*` directory

## Deploying Docker Locally
- Deploying:
```commandline
docker-compose --env-file sample_env up --build -d
```
- Cleanup:
```commandline
docker-compose down
```
